To install, just copy these files into your web tree. The pages are served to the user as static HTML and Javascript files, and all code executes in their browser. There are a few things you may need to do on your server, such as setup a node for transactions to be broadcasted, along with some server side scripts for the AJAX calls for the same. Those are a simple steps but not described here.
